## Description

Being a Stellar Quester comes with perks, however the perks are only as claimable as the proof you have of your Stellar Quest account. To this end we're looking for an interesting, innovative web application for proving original ownership of Stellar Quest badges.

This application should feature an Albedo login fully utilizing proof of signature along with a check of all badges originally received from an official SQ account (buying or trading for SQ badges doesn't count).

From these checks a sharable, verifiable, exportable token or key or code of some sort should be generated such that someone else could comfortably assume the validity of the claim for the public key in question.

The idea is someone wants to give you VIP status at a conference, $100,000 off your tuition, a first class ride on the next trip to the Karman line, but before they can do that they need proof of Stellar Quest greatness.

## Deliverables

- Fully live, client-side only, web application 
- Fully open source and sufficiently documented github repo
- Feature Albedo login
- Clean, detailed export of a proof of ownership

## Ideas

- Maybe the export token/key/code can be read back into the site by a verifier. A sort of image or image + QR code or just QR code that when dropped on the site opens to show the details. Kind of like a transit ticket.
- Maybe white label it a bit such that via url query items we could drop in logo urls or custom colors such to generate a custom experience for different users. Logging in from a university campaign email link? Here's some custom logos and colors to match. NASA advertisement? Looks like it to me.
- Consider employing that one designer friend we all have, these needs to feel slick, intuitive and secure.
