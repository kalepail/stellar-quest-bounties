## Context
https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/issues?q=basic-account-viewer.md

## Description

### What is this task?

When building websites ontop of Stellar, there needs to be a way to access a user's Stellar account. This is where web-wallets like [Albedo](https://albedo.link/), [Rabet](https://rabet.io/) and [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) come in. They allow websites to easily and securely acces your Stellar account.

Your task is to build a simple website which allows you to sign in and log out using a web-wallet like Albedo, Freighter or Rabet.

The website should show some basic information about the account currently logged in:
 * The asset-codes and balances of the account's assets should be shown.
 * The date when the account was created should be shown.
 * The account who created this account should be shown.

For this bounty, the UI is not important. However css and html should be used to create a simple layout. Additionally, the solution should be licensed as open source.
 
### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?
* The hunter should be able to build simple websites with Javascript.

### What are the deliverables?
#### Description
  - The hunter should provide a link to the repository containing the solution.
  - The hunter should publish the website and provide a link to the published website.

#### Review Criteria
  - UI is not important, but there should atleast be a basic layout.
  - The code quality is not important.
  - The code should be checked to insure the integration with the web-wallet is done correctly.
